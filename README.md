# Add to Watch Later for Invidious
 A userscript to add an "add to watch later" button on video thumbnails in Invidious

 # IMPORTANT NOTICE
 WIP, currently not working.
 
 Only matchs the https://yt.artemislena.eu & https://yewtu.be instances for now as I'm trying to get it to work but will add all https instances listed in https://api.invidious.io once the first working version of the script is released.

 # How it works
 1. Login to your Invidious instance
 2. Go to your Playlists Page and create a "Watch Later" playlist (you can name it whatever you want) or skip this step if you would like to use an existing playlist
 3. Hover over the thumbnail of the playlist you want to set as your default "Watch Later" playlist and click on the top right corner button to set and save it.
 4. Now go to you subscriptions or trending page (or any other page with multiple video thumbnails) and hover over any thumbnail to reveal the "add to watch later" button and click on it to add that video to that playlist.
